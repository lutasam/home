I‘m a Master of Engineering student in Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) at Duke University. I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science from Wuhan University of Technology in June 2023. I have practical experience in software development and test engineering from several internships, including software development at TikTok(Bytedance) and test engineering at Huawei Technology. I am currently at Duke University, where my primary area of academic focus centers on Edge Computing. I am eager to further immerse myself in this field and explore its intricacies in greater depth!

During my free time, I frequently immerse myself in playing musical instruments such as the guitar and piano. Lately, I've taken up the violin as well. I have a deep passion for symphonic music, so if you're also a classical music enthusiast, don't hesitate to talk with me!
